<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am doing my bachelor of science in telecommunication at ChongXin College(Â¥áÊñ∞Â≠¶Â†Ç), Shandong University and expected to graduate in June 2023. I also work as a research assistant at [IR Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) in school of computer scienceÔºàÂ±±‰∏úÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÁßëÂ≠¶‰∏éÊäÄÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢Ôºâfor over a year, advised by Prof. Pengjie Ren(‰ªªÈπèÊù∞) and Prof. Xinxin(ËæõÈë´).

<!-- I won first prize scholarships in Research Innovation and Aesthetic Education Accomplishment(Top 3%) and was selected Chongxin College.  -->
<!-- , supervised by Prof. [Honchao Zhou](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhouhongchao/zh_CN/index.htm). -->

My research interest includes recommender system, machine learning and deep learning. I have submitted a paper as second author to TOIS (on review) and two papers in progress. For curriculum reasons, I also have knowledge about computer visions and electrical engineering. I hold three patents in telecommunication. 

I have a good command of English(IELTS: 7.5) and a good knowledge of recommendation system. I'm familiar with popular recommendation algorithms, common datasets, training losses and evaluation metrics. I'm also good at programming, such as data processing or writing codes to implement ideas. 

Interest: Piano(Gr. 10), Electronic Organ(Gr. 10), Badminton(No.5 men's team in SDUQD). 

<!-- I am willing to learning new things and have good self-disipline and strong mental resiliency when facing adversities. Hopefully, we can speak about research in the future.  -->
